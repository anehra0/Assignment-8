        <section>
            <h2>My Story</h2>
            <p>My journey into Information Systems began with a strong foundation in the sciences. As a Biology major with minors in Chemistry and Public Health, I developed a deep appreciation for systematic thinking, data analysis, and problem-solving. This scientific background has proven invaluable as I transition into the world of Information Systems, where analytical thinking and attention to detail are crucial.</p>
            
            <p>The transition from Biology to Information Systems might seem unconventional, but it reflects my belief that the best solutions often come from interdisciplinary approaches. My scientific training has taught me to approach problems methodically, analyze data critically, and communicate findings effectively – all skills that are essential in the IS field.</p>

            <h2>Academic Excellence</h2>
            <p>Throughout my academic career, I have maintained a strong commitment to excellence. My GPA of 3.82/4.00 and recognition as High Distinction graduate demonstrate my dedication to learning and academic achievement. Being consistently named to the Executive Dean's List and receiving the Founders Scholar designation from 2022-2025 reflects my sustained commitment to academic excellence.</p>
            
            <p>The prestigious fellowship I received – worth $23,000 from Kelley Fellowship and MSIS Fellowship – is not just financial support, but recognition of my potential to contribute meaningfully to the Information Systems field. This investment in my education motivates me to excel and give back to the community that has supported my growth.</p>

            <h2>Research & Professional Experience</h2>
            <p>My experience as a Research Assistant at the Busey Lab has been transformative. Working on cognitive experiments and analyzing large datasets has given me hands-on experience with the kind of complex problem-solving that defines the IS field. I've learned to work with diverse teams, manage multiple projects simultaneously, and translate complex data into actionable insights.</p>
            
            <p>My role as a Genetics Teaching Assistant taught me the importance of clear communication and effective knowledge transfer – skills that are essential for any IS professional who needs to bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs.</p>
            
            <p>The clinical internship experience provided valuable exposure to healthcare systems and the critical role that information systems play in patient care and clinical decision-making. Working with Epic EHR systems gave me insight into enterprise-level software and the importance of user experience in professional applications.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Leadership & Social Impact</h2>
            <p>As Vice President of Amnesty International, I've learned the importance of leadership, organization, and social responsibility. Leading awareness campaigns and volunteer events has taught me how to mobilize people around important causes and manage complex logistics – skills that translate directly to project management and team leadership in professional settings.</p>
            
            <p>My involvement in human rights advocacy reflects my belief that technology should be used to make the world a better place. This perspective drives my interest in using Information Systems to solve real-world problems and create positive social impact.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Personal Interests</h2>
            <p>Beyond my professional pursuits, I enjoy activities that challenge my mind and keep me engaged. Strategic Chess helps me develop analytical thinking and long-term planning skills. Competitive Soccer keeps me physically active and teaches teamwork and perseverance. My interest in Watch Collecting reflects my appreciation for precision, craftsmanship, and attention to detail – qualities that serve me well in technical work.</p>
            
            <p>I'm also multilingual, speaking English, Punjabi, and Hindi fluently. This linguistic diversity has given me a broader perspective on communication and cultural understanding, which is increasingly important in our globalized, technology-driven world.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
            <p>As I continue my MSIS journey, I'm excited about the opportunities to apply my diverse background to solve complex business problems through technology. My goal is to become a well-rounded Information Systems professional who can bridge the gap between technical solutions and business needs, while always keeping the human impact of technology in mind.</p>
            
            <p>I'm particularly interested in exploring areas like data analytics, digital transformation, and healthcare informatics – fields where my scientific background and technical skills can create meaningful impact.</p>
