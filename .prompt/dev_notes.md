Prompt One:
"Can you generate the HTML and CSS structure for all these pages: index.html, about.html, resume.html, projects.html, contact.html, and thankyou.html. Make sure the structures allow for the following requirements: semantic HTML, responsive design with styles.css, accessibility (labels, alt text), contact form validation, and consistent layout. After generating, show me all files in a single folder structure."

Cursor created all the different pages I asked for along with the correct structure required. Each page had a consistant layout and also had unqiue headings/labels based on the title of the page. I accepted this AI output. 

Prompt Two:
"Can you make sure that all pages are responsive for mobile users as well."

AI output and action taken:
Cursor added responsiveness for mobile user by adding css styling for 480px and 768px screens. I added the changes it recommended but modified the size of one of my pictures becuase I felt it looked too small. 

Prompt Three:
"On the resume.html, can you add a button that would allow the user to download a pdf version of my resume. I've added my resume in pdf form under files. Make sure it would work on desktop and mobile. Also make sure it matches the style I have going currently."

Cursor checked my resume and then created the button style on styles.css page. It then updated my resume.html file to refer to the location of the resume. Lastly it checked the responsiveness. I accepted this output after testing its functionality on the website.
